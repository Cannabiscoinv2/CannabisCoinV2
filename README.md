## Wallet Update to v0.14.2 (Mandatory Update)

Due to the inactivity of the original developer since 2021, the community has taken the initiative to release this mandatory update to ensure the continued stability of the network.

Moving forward, this marks a new chapter for CannabisCoin, as we work together to provide ongoing improvements and ensure a strong future for the project. 

We are committed to maintaining and evolving CannabisCoin for the benefit of all community members. This update is **mandatory** to ensure continued participation in the network.

### Key Updates:
- **DGW3 (Dark Gravity Wave 3) Integration**: 
  - A new difficulty-readjustment algorithm that fixes known exploits and enhances security.
  - DGW3 will activate at block 7,175,000 to help mitigate 51% attacks and other vulnerabilities.
- **Block Time Adjustment**: 
  - From block 7,175,000, block time will increase from 42 seconds to 100 seconds to further enhance security and reduce the risk of 51% attacks.

  - New hardcoded seed nodes added to keep the chain running smoothly and more stable.
- **Checkpoints**: 
  - Checkpoints have been added from block 6,800,000 up to block 7,135,000 to prevent chain splits.
- **Protocol Enforcement**: 
  - Protocol 70020 will be enforced, rejecting outdated wallets and nodes starting from block 7,175,000.
- **One-Time Developer Fee**: 
  - A one-time developer fee of 250,000 CANN has been allocated for marketing, the CANNdy charity, and ongoing expenses. This will be sent to the address: **CTeKMjzvoSLLR5WBfVL6XEi9g4fRDSFWeS**.
- **Old Developer Fee Excluded**: 
  - The old developer fee address has been excluded from the chain, as the previous developer has not been active since 2018.

What is CannabisCoin?
-------------------------------------------

CannabisCoin (CANN) is a peer-to-peer Internet digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world.

It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs from Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware.

CannabisCoin is the payment solution for Marijuana dispensaries, retailers and merchants.

CannabisCoin crypto currency is backed by Marijuana where it is accepted.

What does CannabisCoin represent?
----------------------------------

Put an end to Cannabis / Marijuana prohibition, allow "We the people" freedom of choice and personal privacy!  
Legalize Marijuana!

Cannabis / Marijuana Facts
--------------------------
20 states in the US have legalized cannabis for medical purposes. Colorado and Washington state also permit recreational use of marijuana.

There are two very distinct groups of marijuana strains. One is cannabis; the other is hemp.

Cannabis is potent medicine courtesy of high amounts of CBD, medicinal terpenes, and flavonoids. It also contains varying amounts of THC. The higher the THC, the more pronounced its psychoactive effects

## Cannabis Coin Details:
----------------------
- **Algorithm**: X11  
- **Maximum number of produced Cannabis Coins**: 420,000,000 Coins  
- **Cannabis Coin CANN rewards per block**: Originally 420 coins, but the inflation model reduced the reward. A hard fork at block 2,282,000 changed the reward to 70 coins.  
- **Target per block**: 42 seconds (will be changed to 90 seconds starting from block 7,175,000)  
- **Confirmation time**: 6 confirms  
- **Maturity time**: 100 blocks  
- **Halving**: Every 100,000 blocks before the hard fork. After the fork, halving happens when half of all coins are produced at block 3,969,725, then every 3 million blocks, approximately every 4 years.  
- **Wallet Addresses**: Start with "C" for Cannabis!  
- **Ports**:  
  - RPC Port: 39347  
  - P2P Port: 39348  


**"We are undertaking this initiative for the benefit of the community, as we, like many others, continue to hold CannabisCoin. Unfortunately, the previous developer has not been active since 2021 and has not responded to any community requests. This effort is not intended to undermine the original developers, but rather to ensure that the project does not fade away. We have contributed our efforts and resources to ensure that the CannabisCoin community can continue to thrive and move forward.

We are committed to ensuring CannabisCoin’s future, and we are working on several exciting updates, including restarting the CANNdy charity, enlisting on exchanges, releasing a new website, and much more."**
